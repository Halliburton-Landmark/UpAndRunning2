# Telegram-Bot / -Notifications
Receiving Telegram-notifications using the built-in Telegram-bot is quite easy but needs a bit of configuration:

* Create a new Telegram-bot using the [Botfather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
* Insert the received API-Token into your configuration-file as `telegramBotApiKey`.
* Start a conversation with the newly created bot to receive your personal user-id.
* Set this user-id as notification-target for the selected websites.
* Done!
